# Delta
Delta is a multipurpose discord bot with fun and moderation features and some linux like commands. This bot was made for my friends, and for myself to learn programming.
Suggestions are always welcome! You can try to set it up by yourself, or you can just invite it.

## Setup
Install all the required packages with this command. **Make sure you install [py-cord][py-cord] instead of discord.py!**
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then create an `.env` file, and change the config to your liking. After that just run the bot with this command:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage
This bot uses the new discord permissions system. That means you can override the required permissions for commands however you like in discord's integrations menu.
