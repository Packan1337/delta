# Delta
Delta is a multipurpose discord bot with fun and moderation features and commands. This bot was made for my friends, and for myself to test my programming knowledge.
I made this bot to "extend" discord features.
Development can be slow because i can only work on it in my free time. You can try to set it up by yourself, or you can just invite it.
